# Goalie Pulling Analysis Code

This is a couple of recursive functions to calculate the Expected Points values for a team given score differential,
time left, and whether they pull their goalie or not. The original concept can be found in the
[Pulling  the Goalie: Hockey and Investment Implications](http://static.ow.ly/docs/Pulling%20the%20Goalie%20Hockey%20and%20Investment%20Implications_7nSt.pdf)
paper by Clifford Asness and Aaron Brown. As of right now it funs fast for up to ~5 minutes left in the game. I haven't
tested further but I'm sure there are optimizations to be made in the code. I you have have any please submit a pull request.
Thanks hope people find this helpful.
